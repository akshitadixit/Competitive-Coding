# Dynamic Programming

## Basics

### Identifying:
- Choice (if a certain element be included or rejected)
- Optimal stuff (min, max)

### Solving:
1. Recursive
2. Memoization
3. Top-down

## Problems overview:
1. O-1 Knapsack

⬜️ subset sum \
⬜️ equal sum partition \
⬜️ count of subset sum \
⬜️ min subset sum diff \
⬜️ target sum \
⬜️ no of subset sum given diff 

2. Unbounded knapsack
3. Fibonacci
4. LCS
5. LIS
6. Kadane's
7. Matrix Chain Mult.
8. DP on trees
9. DP on grid
10. Others
