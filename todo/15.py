'''
Given an array of integers. Find Inversion Count. 

Inversion count indicates how far (or close) the array
is from being sorted. If array is already sorted then
the inversion count is 0. If an array is sorted in the
reverse order then the inversion count is the maximum. 

Formally, two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion
if a[i] > a[j] and i < j
